# NathanBot
A fun little discord bot I coded in Python using GPT 3.5 Turbo's API. The goal was to create a discord bot you could talk to and would mimic the behavior of myself, through a customized GPT prompt in the code. It also includes code allowing the bot to join a voice chat and talk using an AI recreation of my voice.
